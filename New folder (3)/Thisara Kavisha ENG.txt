Dear mr rajpal,

Hi, It's thisara kavishan from E mart company. I hope this letter doesn't make your day dull, but we have some new decisions.

We hired your company team for our project, we had high hopes. We thought it would be as  a super-cool science project, but it turned out to be more like an ugly art .  

Regrettably,, we hav fallen short of our client's expectations. They may feel as though they ordered a pizza but received a bread in the mail.

 So, here are some suggestions from us,

1.Communicate more- It's always nice to know what's happening, a bit like spoilers for a TV show, but actually helpful.
2.Stick to the rules- The project guidelines are not like a serving suggestion, they're more like a recipe. Please follow them.
3.Quality matters- It's not just about getting it done, it's about getting it done right. Let's try to make our project the caviar of all projects, not the spam.
4.Time is of the essence- As the saying goes, better three hours too soon than a minute too late.

Now, if this doesn't work out, we might need to consider breaking up this company affair, I mean banning the contract. And it's only fair that in such a case, you would bear the cost of the additional work needed or provide a refund. 
We're counting on you to turn this around. So let's roll up our sleeves, or put on our thinking caps, or whatever cliche motivatess you!

Looking forward to better days from you your team mr rajpal.

Thisara kavishan,
Manager,
